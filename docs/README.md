# Slides for Vault Workshops
Please do **NOT** place any slides or any other content in this diretory. Slides for Vault workshops should be placed under the [slides](./slides) sub-directory of this directory.  We only have this `docs` directory because it is required in order to publish the workshop slides with GitHub Pages.
