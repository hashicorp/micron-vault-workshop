title: Vault Encryption as a Service
teaser: Show how Vault's Transit secrets engine provides encryption as a service.
description: The Vault Transit secrets engine allows Vault to function as an encryption-as-a-service,
  encrypting and decrypting data stored outside of Vault. In this track, you will
  use the Transit secrets engine with a Python web app and a MySQL database. The latter
  is the same database used in the track, [Vault Dynamic Database Credentials](https://instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/vault-dynamic-database-credentials),
  but this track can be used independently of that one since its setup script configures
  Vault's Database secrets engine against the database.

  title: Enable the Transit Secrets Engine
  teaser: Enable the Transit secrets engine on the Vault server to enable Vault's
    Encryption-as-a-Service.
  assignment: |-
    The Transit secrets engine allows Vault to function as an encryption-as-a-service.

    In this track, you will use the Transit secrets engine with a Python web app that talks to a MySQL server.  Both of these run on the same VM as the Vault server, which is run in "dev" mode with root token set to `root`.

    The web app can be viewed on the "Web App" tab. You don't actually need to use it until the third challenge, but we exposed it to satisfy the curious.

    All secrets engines must be enabled before they can be used. Check which secrets engines are currently enabled on the "Vault CLI" tab.
    ```
    vault secrets list
    ```

    Note that the Transit secrets engine is not enabled. Please enable an instance of it at the path "lob_a/workshop/transit" so that the members of Line of Business A can use it.

    ```
    vault secrets enable -path=lob_a/workshop/transit transit
    ```
    Other lines of busines could create their own instances of the Transit engine.

      Secrets engines are Vault plugins that store, generate, or encrypt data.

      Vault's Transit secrets engine functions as Vault's Encryption-as-a-Service, encrypting and decrypting data stored outside of Vault.

      In this track, you'll see how the Transit engine can encrypt and decrypt data stored in a MySQL database.

  title: Create a Key for the Transit Secrets Engine
  teaser: Create an encryption key for the Transit secrets engine on the Vault server
    so that it can encrypt and decrypt data stored outside of Vault.
  assignment: |-
    In order to use the Transit secrets engine, you need to create at least one encryption key to use with it.

    Create the "customer-key" encryption key:
    ```
    vault write -f lob_a/workshop/transit/keys/customer-key
    ```

    That was easy!

      In this challenge, you will create an encryption key that the Transit engine you created in the previous challenge will use to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data in the MySQL database running on the Vault server.

  title: Use the Web App Without Vault
  teaser: Use the python web application without Vault. This will allow users to see
    sensitive data when looking at database rows.
  assignment: |-
    The web app can be viewed on the "Web App" tab. You'll want to click the icon in the upper right corner of the tabs area to hide the assignment window so that you can see the entire UI of the web app. Click it again to display the assignment window.

    The web app has two sections:
    1. Records View: This displays what a real user would see after any encrypted data has been decrypted.
    1. Database View: This displays raw records from the database. If any items are encrypted in the database, they will not be decrypted.

    In its initial state, no records have been encrypted by Vault. So, you will essentially see the same data in both views. (The headers and order of the columns are different.) Go ahead and confirm that.

    The web app was already started by the track's first challenge.

    Click the "Add Record" button and add a new record with some fake data. Then check that the new record is not encrypted in the Database View.

    In the next challenge, you'll enable Vault for the application and see the Transit engine in action.

  title: Use the Web App With Vault
  teaser: Use the python web application with Vault. This will prevent users from
    seeing sensitive data when looking at new database rows.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge, you will stop the Python web app, edit its configuration file to use Vault, and see how new records are encrypted by Vault's Transit engine.

    As a bonus, you'll see that the web app is now logging into the MySQL database that stores its data with short-lived credentials retrieved from Vault's Database secrets engine. These credentials are dynamically generated on the fly when the app is started.

    You first need to determine the process ID (PID) of the running web app and stop it. The PID of the web app can be found by running this command:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep app.py
    ```

    It can then be stopped by running this command against the first process ID you see for the running application:<br>
    `kill -9 <PID>`<br>
    Be sure to pick the PID from the line with the command, `python3 app.py`, rather than the line with the command, `grep --color=auto app.py`.

    Now, you should edit the "config.ini" file on the "Config File" tab, doing the following:

    1. Change the first line of the "\[VAULT\]" section that has `Enabled = False` to `Enabled = True`.
    2. Change the next line that has `DynamicDBCreds = False` to `DynamicDBCreds = True`.
    3. Then save the "config.ini" file.

    <br>
    You should now restart the web app in the background with the following commands:

    ```
    cd /home/vault/transit-app-example/backend
    python3 app.py &
    ```

    After running those commands, press your `<enter>` or `<return>` key to get your prompt back.

    Note that the log will show a message like "using dynamic credentials from Vault: v-token-workshop-a-LcIkgRzHwTF2m with password A1a-U9QfaBp6hQaynvJy". This shows that the web app got dynamic, short-lived credentials from Vault's Database secrets engine. It then uses these to login to the MySQL server.

    Return to the "Web App" tab and add another record. (Remember to click Instruqt's assignment toggle icon to hide the assignment so that you can see the "Add Record" button.) Then check that sensitive fields of the new record is encrypted in the Database View. In particular, the birth_date, social_security_number, address, and salary fields are all encrypted for the new record.

    Next, login to the Vault UI with token `root` and click on the "lob_a/workshop/transit" secrets engine on the Secrets tab of the Vault UI. Then click on the "customer-key" key. Then select the "Versions" tab. Rotate the key by clicking the "Rotate encryption key" button and confirming that you really want to rotate it by clicking "Rotate". You will now see two versions of the key.

    Go back to the web app, add another record, and then look at the record in the Database View. Verify that is is also encrypted.  Note that the first record you added after enabling Vault and the Transit engine has encrypted fields with encrypted values starting with "vault:v1" while the new record has fields with encrypted values starting with "vault:v2".

    Vault used the new version of the key to encrypt the new record. Someone with the old version of the key could not decrypt this new record.  But Vault can still decrypt the older record that was encrypted with the first version of the key. Finally, if desired, data encrypted with an older version of the key can be rewrapped with the newest version using the Transit engine's `rewrap` endpoint.

      In this challenge, you will use the Python web application with Vault enabled. You will add a record to the database and see that the new data **is** encrypted.

      As a bonus, you'll see that the web app is now logging into the MySQL database that stores its data with short-lived credentials retrieved from Vault's Database secrets engine. These credentials are dynamically generated on the fly when the app is started.

      Finally, you'll use the Vault UI to rotate the Transit engine's "customer-key" encryption key. You'll see that the web app uses the new key for encrypting and decrypting new records but can still use the original key to decyrpt older records.
